# Traffic-and-contamination-study-on-Madrid-city

This is a study on the relationship between the vehicle traffic on the city of Madrid and the levels of pollution within the city, while also trying to relate these with weather variables, such as temperature, rain or wind. For this, several software components will be used for each of the steps performed by the study. The data used for the study comes from the open data catalogs available, offered by the Madrid city government (https://datos.madrid.es/portal/site/egob) and AEMET (http://www.aemet.es/es/datos_abiertos/AEMET_OpenData).

These are just the components used by myself on this study, they can be vastly improved, both on coding and on performance. Also, these are independant from each other.

Last, this study was done for the Master Thesis of Visual Analytics and Big Data master of La Universidad de la Rioja, Spain.
